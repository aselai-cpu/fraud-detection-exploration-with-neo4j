        **Mule Characteristics:**
        - High throughput (≥$10,000)
        - Quick turnaround (≤48 hours)
        - Money in ≈ Money out (within 10%)
        - Minimal balance retention
        - Just a conduit, not storage

        **Detection Formula:**
        total_in ≥ $10,000
        AND hold_time ≤ 48 hours
        AND |total_in - total_out| / total_in < 0.10
    end note
