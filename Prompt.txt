# Fraud Detection System - Project Specification

## Vision
Demonstrate and understand Graph Database Knowledge Discovery through a practical fraud detection application.

## Mission
Build a comprehensive graph database-based fraud detection system that showcases how graph technology enables knowledge discovery in financial transaction analysis.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Data Model & Ontology
- Design a comprehensive ontology for financial transactions focused on fraud detection
- Model entities: Accounts, Customers, Transactions, Devices, IP Addresses, Merchants
- Define relationships: Ownership, Transaction flows, Device usage, Geographic patterns
- Support fraud pattern detection: Circular flows, fan-out/fan-in, money mules, shared infrastructure

### 2. Data Capture & Storage
- Implement data capture for bank accounts and transactions
- Store data in Neo4j graph database
- Create appropriate indexes for query performance
- Support bulk data import and real-time updates

### 3. Fraud Detection Capabilities
- Detect fraud rings through graph pattern matching
- Identify circular money flows (money laundering)
- Detect fan-out patterns (structuring)
- Detect fan-in patterns (collection)
- Identify money mule accounts
- Detect shared infrastructure patterns (devices, IPs)
- Calculate risk scores based on graph patterns

### 4. Sample Data Generation
- Create realistic sample banking data generator
- Embed known fraud patterns for testing
- Generate diverse transaction patterns (legitimate and fraudulent)
- Support configurable data volumes

### 5. Analyst User Interface
- Build web-based dashboard for fraud analysts
- Enable interactive fraud pattern discovery
- Provide account investigation tools
- Support network visualization
- Generate investigation reports

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j 4.x/5.x
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) + Hexagonal Architecture

### Supporting Technologies
- Docker & Docker Compose (for easy deployment)
- PlantUML (for architecture diagrams)
- Any additional libraries that facilitate implementation

## Documentation Requirements

Create comprehensive, multi-level documentation:

### 1. Novice Guide
- Explain graph database concepts in simple terms
- Introduce fraud detection basics
- Guide beginners through the system
- Use analogies and examples

### 2. Professional Guide
- Technical documentation for developers
- Architecture overview
- API reference
- Implementation details
- Best practices

### 3. Philosophical Foundation
- Document design decisions and rationale
- Explain historical context and trade-offs
- Discuss why graph databases for fraud detection
- Reference academic research and industry practices

### 4. Code Walkthrough
- Detailed explanation of Python codebase
- Walk through key components
- Explain design patterns used
- Provide code examples

### 5. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
- Address common questions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance tips
- Configuration help

### 6. Analyst Guide
- Step-by-step guide for fraud analysts
- How to discover fraud patterns
- How to use the UI effectively
- Investigation workflows
- Case study examples

## Architecture Requirements

### 1. Ontology Diagram
- Visual representation of the fraud detection data model
- Show all entities, relationships, and properties
- Include relationship types and cardinalities

### 2. Domain-Driven Design
- Implement DDD principles:
  - **Entities**: Core business objects with identity
  - **Value Objects**: Immutable domain concepts
  - **Repositories**: Abstract data access (interfaces)
  - **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to entities
  - **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Isolate domain from infrastructure
- Document all design decisions

### 3. Architecture Diagrams
- **PlantUML Diagrams**:
  - Sequence diagrams for key workflows
  - Entity relationship diagrams
  - Component interaction diagrams
- **C4 Diagrams**:
  - Context diagram (system in environment)
  - Container diagram (high-level architecture)
  - Component diagram (detailed component structure)
- **Additional Diagrams** (as needed):
  - Deployment diagrams
  - Data flow diagrams
  - State diagrams (if applicable)
