### Vision
Understand Graph DB knowledge Discovery

### Mission
Create a graph DB based solution to exemplify the  Graph DB knowledge Discovery 

### Actions
- Create a ontology for transactionss (focus on fraude detection): My Guess is that we need to track accounts and transaction users may be some more 
- Capture Bank Accounts and Transactions 
- Allow Analyst to discover Fraud Rings 
- Create sample data that can feed to Graph DB
- Create UI for an Analyst to discover fraude

### Reference 

- @accelerate-fraud-detection-graph-database.pdf

## Technology
Language should be Pyton,  graph  database or anyother tech that facilate implementing. 

###Documentation
Create a comprehensive documentation about the solution
version of documentations
1. For a Novice, explaing concepts in basics
2. To Professional, about the solution and process
3. Create document explaining philosphyical foundation and history behind decisions 
4. Create document walk through the python code
5. Create FAQ 
6. Create document how analyst can discover fraud through this application 

### Architecture
1. Create diagram on ontology for the fraude detection
1. Use domain Driven design ( Entities, AntiCorruption layers etc. ) document all design decisions
1. Create comprehensive architecture diagram, use PlantUML, DDD for sequrence and entity diagram
2. If there's need to directly create diagrams for ease of conceptual understanding do it
3. Create C4 diagramss
